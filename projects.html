                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, it encompasses a range of patient parameters such as cancer history, kidney issues, previous heart conditions and lifestyle habits like eating and doing exercise. The primary algorithm employed is the decision tree, chosen for its superior accuracy among various options. Additionally, to optimize memory usage, the LightGBM framework was integrated into the project. To provide a user-friendly interface, Flask was utilized to create a local server hosting an HTML form. This form allows users to input their information, which is then encoded and processed by the trained machine learning model. Finally, the output is presented as a percentage representing the risk of heart disease. This project not only showcases the application of machine learning in healthcare but also emphasizes usability and accessibility through its intuitive interface.</p>

                <h3><u>Object Oriented Design of Vehicle Parking System</u></h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>The Parking Lot System project is a personal project focused on creating a user-friendly parking management solution. It comes in two versions: Basic and Advanced.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Basic Version, the system handles simple parking tasks with one entrance and exit, managed by an admin. However, it doesn't deal with different vehicle types or multiple parking levels.
                        <br><br>
                        The Advanced Version solves these challenges. It supports multiple floors and has separate parking spaces for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. While it's a command-line tool without fancy graphics, it's all about showcasing solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this project, I've sharpened my OOP skills and shown how to tackle real-world problems with thoughtful design and coding.</p>
